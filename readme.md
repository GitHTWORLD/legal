## Set Up GitHub Pages
1. Create a public repository under the account `GITHTWORLD` named `legal` (or your preferred name).  
2. Add `terms.md` and `privacy.md` to the repository.  
3. In **Settings → Pages**, set **Source** to `Deploy from a branch`, then choose the default branch, and `/root` or `/docs` folder.  
4. Once published, GitHub Pages will provide a URL like `https://githtworld.github.io/legal/terms` (or simply `https://githtworld.github.io/terms` if using the root of the user site).  
5. Update your invoice footer to point to the final published URLs.
